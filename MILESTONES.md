Use this file to commit information clearly documenting your milestones'
content. If you want to store more information/details besides what's required
for the milestones that's fine too. Make sure that your TA has had a chance to
sign off on your milestones each week (before the deadline); typically you
should discuss your material with them before finalizing it here.


### Milestone 1

##### Brief description of your planned DSL idea
Our DSL will codify modern staff notation used to represent music into a
textual format.
Use cases: 
* Modern staff notation used in sheet music is graphical, and might be unnecessarily
difficult to store/transfer digitally (e.g. Requiring scans of paper documents,
storage in graphical formats, compatibility issues).
* Conversion to text allows easier ability to gather metadata about a piece of music.
* For composers, having music in a textual format allows an easy way of version
controlling compositions.
* In terms of future expansion, the abstraction allows easy construction of custom
formatting and style options for converting the text back to a graphical format.

##### Notes of any important changes/feedback from TA discussion:
* TA suggest a useful feature could be to implement loops, such as for defining
repeating elements of a piece without having to manually write every segment.
*  As someone who did not know much about music, TA liked our idea.

##### Any planned follow-up tasks or features still to design:
* An important feature to design and implement would be to take a text input in the DSL
and generate a file (perhaps a pdf or an image) of the sheet music
